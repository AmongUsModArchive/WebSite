## Installing Mods Using Installation Packages
### What is an installation package?
An installation package is generally a zip compressed file that usually only contains the mod.<br>
The **size of the installation package is small**, making it the recommended option for installing mods.
### How to install mods using an installation package?
This chapter will use **TownOfHostEnhanced** as a demonstration to guide you through the installation of mods.
> [!NOTE] Skip part of the tutorial...
> If you have already downloaded the mod you want to install, please start from step 5.
1. Open the Github repository of the mod you want to install.
> The name of the mod repository is usually the full name of the mod.<br>
> Searching for `full name of the mod` + `GitHub` on [Bing](https://cn.bing.com) usually leads you to the mod you want.<br>
> The mod archive on this site also provides a link to the Github repository, you can click the `GithubRepository` badge to go directly.
2. After opening, click the **tag icon** below the `Releases` on the right sidebar.

This marks the end of the installation.
## Installing Mods Using Lazy Package
Most mods no longer provide lazy packages, so I no longer provide lazy package installation tutorials.<br>
I prefer that players have the ability to solve problems on their own rather than constantly seeking `lazy packages`, `installation programs`, and other `lazy` things.<br>
This is not about **suffering in vain**, but rather a great opportunity for practice.
