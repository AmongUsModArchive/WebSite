Moe originally built websites for TOH-RE.<br>
Later, due to the conflict between Moe and Loonie, Loonie frequently stripped Moe of his power.<br>
As Loonie's black material was gradually exposed, Loonie officially stepped down.<br>
TOH-RE was taken over by Moe and was renamed to Town of Host-Enhanced.<br>
