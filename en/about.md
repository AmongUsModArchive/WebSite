“Among Us Mod Archive” is a website that records all Among Us mods that are open-sourced on GitHub.<br>
I have collected most of the Among Us mods here for players to view, and you can quickly understand the H-series mods & full client-side mods and functional plugins of Among Us through this website.<br>
## Advantag of this site
- **Search** function, allowing you to quickly find the mod you want.
- Provide **multi-platform installation tutorials**, teaching you how to install mods step by step.
- **Troubleshooting** support, common questions are answered here.
- **Multi-language support**.
- **Fast loading speed**, relying on the advantage of [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/zh/), we make it possible for the client to quickly load the page.
