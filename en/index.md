This is a documentation website for Among Us mods.<br>
> Among Us is a strategy-based casual party game developed and published by Innersloth LLC.

I have collected most of the Among Us mods for players to view. You can quickly learn about the Host Mod and non-Host Mod mods of Among Us through this website.

In addition, I have also included some functional plugins and created tutorials to help players quickly get started with Among Us mods.
