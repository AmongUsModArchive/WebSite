description: "Among Us Mod Archive" is a website that records all Among Us mods that are open-sourced on GitHub. Our initial motivation for creating this website was to provide completely free content and open-source it on GitHub. However, to provide high-quality content, we have invested a significant amount of money. This includes purchasing servers, registering domain names, and using CDN services, all of which require substantial financial resources. We are just a group of passionate students with limited funds and cannot afford these expenses. We hope you can lend a hand. Even a sponsorship of less than $5 would provide us with immense assistance.

## Why should you sponsor us?
"Among Us Mod Archive" is a website that records all Among Us mods that are open-sourced on GitHub.<br>
The initial purpose of creating this website is to provide completely free content (*after all, the website can't do anything special for paid content*), and to open-source it on GitHub.<br>
However, in order to provide high-quality content, we have invested a lot of money.<br>
From **server purchase**, **domain registration**, to **CDN services**, all of these require a lot of money.<br>
We are just a group of passionate students with limited funds, and we cannot afford these expenses.<br>
We hope you can lend a hand, even a sponsorship of less than 5 CNY can provide us with great help.
